        <h2>Your Trainer Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            At age 11, all children are given the choice to choose their first Pokemon from Professor Oak, world-reknowned Pokemon researcher, and begin their Pokemon journey
            as a Pokemon Trainer or Pokemon Coordinator. Growing up, you had dreamed for the day that you would choose your very own Pokemon, form your dream team, and win all 
            battles and Contests that came your way. Your motivation was strengthend by willpower and a desire to prove yourself to the world, a goal that your parents encourage 
            you in.
        </p>
        <h2>Exploring Kanto</h2>
        <p>
            "The Kanto region has a very temperate climate and not many notable landscape features, though this may be due to the region's origins in the Generation I games.
            The majority of the Kanto region are forests and plains. Many of the major Kanto cities are in the center of the region, with close access to virtually every environment such as the sea, mountains, forests, etc. Kanto is mostly dominated by land, but has a large bay in the middle which opens to a sea in the southwest. Kanto has a contrast between urban cities and rural towns. Kanto has several mountain ranges, which are mostly in northern and western Kanto. Indigo Plateau and Victory Road mountain range divides Kanto from the neighboring Johto region.

        <h2>Filling Your Pokedex</h2>
        <p>
            Your first Pokemon from Professor Oak did come with a price, though a very simple one. As a researcher, Professor Oak needed as much organic data from the wild as he could 
            possibly get. In exchange for your Starter Pokemon, you would do your best to fill out one of Professor Oak's Pokedexes, a handheld computer that would track any Pokemon that 
            you might encounter on your journey. You would video call with the Professor periodically to send him the data from your Pokedex and update him on all the Pokemon that you've 
            encoutered.
